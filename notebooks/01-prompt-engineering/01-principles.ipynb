    "GPTs can’t read your mind. If outputs are too long, ask for brief replies. If outputs are too simple, ask for expert-level writing. If you dislike the format, demonstrate the format you’d like to see. The less GPTs have to guess at what you want, the more likely you’ll get it.\n",
    "GPTs can confidently invent fake answers, especially when asked about esoteric topics or for citations and URLs. In the same way that a sheet of notes can help a student do better on a test, providing reference text to GPTs can help in answering with fewer fabrications.\n",
    "Just as it is good practice in software engineering to decompose a complex system into a set of modular components, the same is true of tasks submitted to GPTs. Complex tasks tend to have higher error rates than simpler tasks. Furthermore, complex tasks can often be re-defined as a workflow of simpler tasks in which the outputs of earlier tasks are used to construct the inputs to later tasks.\n",
    "If asked to multiply 17 by 28, you might not know it instantly, but can still work it out with time. Similarly, GPTs make more reasoning errors when trying to answer right away, rather than taking time to work out an answer. Asking for a chain of reasoning before an answer can help GPTs reason their way toward correct answers more reliably.\n",
    "Compensate for the weaknesses of GPTs by feeding them the outputs of other tools. For example, a text retrieval system can tell GPTs about relevant documents. A code execution engine can help GPTs do math and run code. If a task can be done more reliably or efficiently by a tool rather than by a GPT, offload it to get the best of both.\n",
    "Improving performance is easier if you can measure it. In some cases a modification to a prompt will achieve better performance on a few isolated examples but lead to worse overall performance on a more representative set of examples. Therefore to be sure that a change is net positive to performance it may be necessary to define a comprehensive test suite (also known an as an \"eval\").\n",
